# My ansible hosts file looked like this:
# [ubuntu-server]
# 192.168.64.14 ansible_user=server

# I used this command as I had pubkey for user 'server'
ansible-playbook playbook/add-user.yml --ask-become-pass

# If you don't and you want to use password authentication for SSH use this:
ansible-playbook playbook/add-user.yml --ask-pass --ask-become-pass

# You will probably face this error:
FAILED! => {"msg": "to use the 'ssh' connection type with passwords or pkcs11_provider, you must install the sshpass program"}

# In this case you need to install sshpass first and run it and then run the playbook again.
